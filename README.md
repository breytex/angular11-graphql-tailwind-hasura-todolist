# Ng awesome todolist

Had to learn some angular and built yet another todolist app with it :D
Stack includes:
- angular 11
- tailwind (some components copy pasted from tailwind UI)
- apollo client for angular
- [graphql codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/)
- [hasura](https://hasura.io/)
- postgres

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend / API

I have deployed a test backend to Heroku: https://ng-awesome-todo.herokuapp.com/v1/graphql

Its also possible to start a local hasura instance with `docker-compose up`. I will provide a postgres dump when the app is done.
